## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on trends, adoption, performance metrics, market dynamics, and environmental impact. Using data-driven methods and visualizations, the repository aims to provide insights for researchers, policymakers, industry professionals, and EV enthusiasts.

## Features

- Data collection and cleaning from multiple sources
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of EV trends
- Analysis of EV specifications (range, battery capacity, charging time, etc.)
- Market analysis: adoption rates, regional trends, and pricing
- Environmental impact assessment of EV adoption
- Predictive modeling (adoption trends, market growth, etc.)
- Interactive dashboards or visual reports (if implemented)

## Dataset

The project uses datasets that may include:
- EV model specifications (make, model, range, battery size, etc.)
- Sales and adoption data by region and year
- Charging infrastructure statistics
- Environmental impact data (CO2 emissions, energy sources)
- Pricing and incentives information

**Sources:**  
(Please specify your data sources, e.g., U.S. Department of Energy, EV Volumes, Kaggle datasets, etc.)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfatty47/Electric-Vehicles.git
   cd Electric-Vehicles
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run analysis scripts or notebooks:**
   - Jupyter notebooks are located in the `notebooks/` directory for step-by-step exploration.
   - Main scripts are in the `src/` directory.

4. **(Optional) Launch dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
